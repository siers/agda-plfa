this repo includes some of the practice exercises from PLFA:
  plfa.part1.peano: associativity and distributivity proofs of + and * over +
  plfa.part1.relations: ≤ properties, trichotomy, even/odd proofs, bitstrings
  plfa.part1.relationsbinary: exercises (marked stretch) about bitstrings
  plfa.part1.negation: <-irreflexive, trichotomy with ≡/<, ⊎-dual-×
  plfa.part1.quantifiers: ∀-distrib-×, (∃[ x ] (x + y ≡ z)) ⇔ (y ≤ z), ∃-distrib-⊎
  plfa.part1.decidable: a few exercises, mostly copypasted definitions
```
